# nekoCover
Bulk Xbox cover art downloader for XBMC4Xbox, using MobCat's API.

## How to use:
- Download and extract the latest release .zip
- Copy "nekoCover" to "Q:/scripts"
- In XBMC, launch Scripts, then select "nekoCover"
- Select the game you'd like to fetch cover art for. If a root directory is selected (ie; "F:/Action"), it'll grab cover art for every game in that folder.
- nekoCover will grab all the appropriate box art for your games! If no box art is found, it'll fall back to the icon stored in MobCat's database. 

## TODO:
- More testing (a few games have errors downloading the cover art, haven't had time to check what specifically is causing the issue)
- Better visual language(?)
- Speed improvements

## Credits:
- MobCat - For making the most comprehensive Xbox database we've ever seen!
